    "Here we are going to learn about the UNIX operating system, and in particular, it's most popular user-friendly avatar, Linux (and even more specifically, Debian based Linux distributions, with focus on Ubuntu). If you are niot a Unix/Linux user, you still need to learn the UNIX environment because under the hood, all other operating systems that need to do *serious* computing have to use Unix. Indeed, MacOS is built on UNIX, and Windows now a days has a UNUIX sub-system to enable users to things that can only really be done in UNIX (like Genomics!). "

    "\n",
    "UNIX is a machine-independent operating system (OS) developed in the 1970s by AT&T programmers (notably Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, fathers of `C`) for programmers (you!). It is multi-user and network-oriented by design, uses plain text files for storing data (no proprietary file formats), and has a strictly hierarchical directory structure (more on this below). This makes it an ideal environment for developing your code and storing your data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* It was designed for developing code and storing data &ndash; an ideal native habitat for programming languages like Python and R!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Robust, stable, secure (very few UNIX viruses and malware &ndash; I am yet to encounter one after almost 10 years!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Free and open source!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scores of small programs available to perform simple tasks &ndash; can be combined easily\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to automate tasks (e.g., using shell scripts)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-user (multiple users can log in and concurrently use computer)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-tasking (can perform many tasks at the same time)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Network-ready (easy to communicate between computers)\n",
    "\n",
    "* UNIX has been around since the early 1970's and will likely be around at the end of your career (the hard work you are putting into learning UNIX will pay off over a lifetime!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazing support &ndash; a large body of tutorials and support web sites are readily available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basically all resources for High-Performance Computing (computer clusters, large workstations, etc.) run a UNIX or Linux operating system."

    ">**32-bit vs 64-bit:** The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU), handles information. A 64-bit OS handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system. Specifically, while 32 bits of information can only access 4 GB of RAM, a 64-bit machine can access essentially unlimited system memory (though this is not yet physically possible)!
