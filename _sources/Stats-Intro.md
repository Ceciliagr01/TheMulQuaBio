# Introduction to this section

This section of TheMulQuaBio course builds on the computing component, introducing you to statistical analyses of data. You will learn statistics in a hands-on on way using the programming language R, interspersed with lectures on statistical concepts.

*The topics covered here assume that you have already worked through at least the basic sections of the [R Chapter](./notebooks/07-R.ipynb) of these materials.*

It is important that you work through the problems in each chapter, particularly as some of the questions ask you to find out about commands and functions not introduced in the chapter's text itself, but which will be relied on in later chapters. By the time you have attended the lectures and workshops, and completed the exercises in this document, you should able to:

* Use R to perform common statistical tests, particularly t, F, and $\chi^{2}$ tests
* Develop ability to build, criticize and interpret linear models, especially linear regression and ANOVA.
* Interpret R output (particularly p values) correctly, and use them appropriately in practical write-ups and presentations
